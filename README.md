# Brain-Tumor-detection-using-transfer-learning-VGG-16-
This project focuses on building a reliable MRI brain tumor classifier using transfer learning with the VGG16 model pre-trained on ImageNet. The model was fine-tuned on MRI datasets containing four classes: pituitary, glioma, meningioma, and notumor.
